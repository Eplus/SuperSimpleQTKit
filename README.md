SuperSimpleQTKit
================

Simple example showing use of the QTKit framework to play a movie using the QTMovie, QTMovieLayer and NSWindow objects. 

A command line interface is used to select the movie path.

Beware of setting the fullscreen variable to TRUE - make sure you know a keyboard shortcut to exit the program! (Xcode/Terminal: Command & .)
